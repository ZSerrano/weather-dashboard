## Description
Created a functioning weather dashboard utilizing geotracking and openweather API calls to generate weather data in a specific location based on the latitude and longitude of the input city.  User can input a city name, and the internal functions display a number of current weather factors (temperature, humidity, UV index, etc.) in a separate container.

## Process
- Created html page to hold the search button and current weather information, as well as an unused container for the five-day forecast
- Created CSS page to style necessary classes and ID's
- Created Javascript page to hold necessary scripts and API calls
- Within the JS page, created a search button that would run a location function utilizing the input city name above the search button
- Location function runs a weather data function to find current weather data utilizing the location information pulled from location function and API
- Within the weather function, created multiple variables to hold different parts of weather data and then appended them all to the same container on the page
