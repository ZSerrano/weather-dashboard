// Create a Search bar that takes an input and saves it to local storage.

// This input is also saved as a clickable button so the user can go back to 
// past searches.  All buttons and input can be on left side of page.

// in the currently searched city, and bottom piece showing the five day forecast
// for the same location.

// Top section will include current temperature, wind speed, humidity, UV index, and
// a coloration around the index displaying which of three conditions it falls under.

// Bottom section will include five cards populated with the five day forecast

// These cards will show the future dates, icons for forecast weather conditions, 
// temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

// Utilize openweather API to gather all of this information and display it properly.
